DATA DRIVEN FILM PRODUCTION: A DATA ANALYSIS FOR STRATEGIC FILM PRODUCTION


## DESCRIPTION:
***
Our company is launching a new movie studio, but with limited experience in the film industry. We need a clear understanding of what drives box office success in order to compete effectively.In this project we analyze current trends and uncover which genres, story themes, production elements, and audience segments consistently lead to high-grossing films. By tapping into data from top-performing movies, we develop a strategic production plan that targets popular content, reduces financial risk, and gives our studio a strong competitive foothold in the entertainment market.

We did correlation to assess the relationship between the datasets and plotted a heatmap to visualize their relationships.

In the jupyter notebook file, an exploratory data analysis was conducted on the datasets and linear regression models were plotted to enable us come up with concrete business recommendations.

We also established answers to our business questions and came up with areas for future improvement for the project.
